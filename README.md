# WorldRestoration

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing
Clone or download project from git and import to prefered editor, then update the gradle project and run the default tasks in order to download all prerequisites.

### Test
Setup a test-spigot-server, with coreprotect, lukperms and griefdefender running.
Building the plugin, and running it on a spigot/paper server will automatically regenerate blocks at x=1000 z=1000 as well as printing out the lesser and greater boundaries of all claims in "world".

Every prerequisite is included in this test server, under spigot in root, flow-math and GreifDefenderApi in other_prerequisites and the rest in the plugins folder:
